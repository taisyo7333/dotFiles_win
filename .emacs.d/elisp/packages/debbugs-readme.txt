This package lets you access the GNU Bug Tracker from within Emacs.

It defines the command `M-x debbugs-gnu' for listing bugs, and the
command `M-x debbugs-gnu-search' for bug searching.

This package works by implementing basic functions to access a debbugs
SOAP server (see <http://wiki.debian.org/DebbugsSoapInterface>).  It
implements the SOAP functions "get_bugs", "newest_bugs", "get_status",
"get_bug_log" and "search_est".  The SOAP functions "get_usertag" and
"get_versions" are not implemented (yet).

You can connect to other debbugs servers by customizing the variable
`debbugs-port'.
